# rig_nft

Is a FPS (First Person Shooter) game where players fend off enemies to collect PC parts.

Players can then exchange parts for Rig Token and purchase more parts to buidl a rig.

Players also have the ability to mint parts on Open Sea as NFTs. These same NFTs can be combined to buidl a rig (Marketplace in development TBD). 

Once a rig is assembled a player can then use the rig to mine Rig Token.

Rig Token will be used to exchange for other tokens on exchanges (TBD).

Currently, only the FPS is playable. Rig building and marketplace coming soon...
